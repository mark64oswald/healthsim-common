# Archived Architecture Documents

This folder contains historical planning and specification documents from the HealthSim development process. These documents were used during the initial design and extraction phases but may no longer reflect the current implementation.

## Contents

| Document | Original Purpose | Status |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| [healthsim-core-spec.md](healthsim-core-spec.md) | Specification for extracting shared code into healthsim-core package | **Completed** - Extraction complete, package now named `healthsim-core` |
| [layered-pattern.md](layered-pattern.md) | Overview of the layered architecture pattern | **Superseded** - See [HEALTHSIM-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDE.md](../../HEALTHSIM-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDE.md) |

## Current Architecture Documentation

For up-to-date architecture information, see:

- [HEALTHSIM-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDE.md](../../HEALTHSIM-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive architecture guide
- [product-architecture.md](../../product-architecture.md) - Product relationships and workflows
- [packages/core/README.md](../../../packages/core/README.md) - healthsim-core package documentation

## Why Archived?

These documents served their purpose during the design and implementation phases:

1. **healthsim-core-spec.md** - Described the plan to extract shared functionality into a common package. This extraction has been completed and the package is now `healthsim-core` (was originally planned as `healthsim-common`).

2. **layered-pattern.md** - Provided an early overview of the system architecture. The concepts are still valid but the document references outdated paths and structures.

These are preserved for historical reference and to understand the design decisions that shaped the current implementation.

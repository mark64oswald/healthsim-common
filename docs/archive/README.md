### DuckDB Architecture Initiative (Completed)
**Location**: `initiatives/duckdb-architecture-completed/`

The DuckDB Unified Data Architecture initiative is complete. All 7 sessions were executed successfully:
- 41-table canonical schema across 6 products
- State management with DuckDB backend
- JSON compatibility layer
- Migration tools
- 605 tests passing

These planning documents are preserved for historical reference.

### State Management v1 Documentation (Superseded)

# PopulationSim

> Query real CDC/Census population data and generate evidence-based cohort specifications grounded in actual disease prevalence, demographics, and social determinants of health.

## What PopulationSim Does

PopulationSim is the **population intelligence** engine of HealthSim. Unlike other products that generate synthetic data, PopulationSim v2.0 provides **access to real embedded data**—148 MB of CDC PLACES, SVI, and ADI data covering every US county, tract, and block group.

This data grounds all HealthSim products in reality. When you generate diabetic patients in Harris County, TX, they reflect the actual 12.1% prevalence rate, not a generic national average.

## Quick Start

**Data lookup:**
```
What is the diabetes prevalence in Harris County, TX?
Show me SVI vulnerability scores for Cook County, IL
```

**Geographic profiles:**
```
Profile San Diego County health indicators
Compare chronic disease rates across California counties
```

**Cohort specification:**
```
Generate a cohort specification for 1,000 Type 2 diabetics in Phoenix metro
Define a heart failure population for Harris County with real prevalence
```

See [hello-healthsim examples](../../hello-healthsim/examples/populationsim-examples.md) for detailed examples with expected outputs.

## Cross-Product Integration

PopulationSim data flows into all other HealthSim products:

| Product | Integration | What It Enables |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **PatientSim** | Demographics, prevalence | Patients with real disease rates for their geography |
| **MemberSim** | Utilization, risk | Actuarially realistic member panels |
| **RxMemberSim** | Adherence, SDOH | Medication patterns reflecting SVI vulnerability |
| **TrialSim** | Feasibility, diversity | Evidence-based site selection and enrollment |

**Example Data Flow:**
```
Request: "Generate 50 diabetic patients for Harris County, TX"

PopulationSim provides:
  - 12.1% diabetes prevalence (CDC PLACES)
  - 72% minority population (SVI demographics)
  - 0.68 vulnerability score (SVI)
  
PatientSim applies:
  - 12.1% diabetes (not generic 10%)
  - Higher comorbidity rates (obesity, HTN)
  - SDOH factors in social history
```

## Output Types

| Output | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Data Response | Raw values with provenance | Ad-hoc queries |
| Geographic Profile | Comprehensive area summary | Research, planning |
| CohortSpecification | Structured population definition | Feeding other products |
| Comparison Report | Multi-geography analysis | Site selection, feasibility |

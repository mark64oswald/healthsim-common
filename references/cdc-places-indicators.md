## Data Quality Indicators

### Confidence Intervals

All PLACES estimates include 95% confidence intervals:
- `{MEASURE}_CrudePrev` - Point estimate
- `{MEASURE}_Crude95CI` - Confidence interval

### Suppression Rules

Data may be suppressed when:
- Population too small for reliable estimate
- Confidence interval exceeds threshold
- Cell size < minimum reporting threshold

### Model Methodology

PLACES uses multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP):
1. Fit model to BRFSS individual data
2. Include demographic and geographic predictors
3. Apply model to census population estimates
4. Generate small area estimates

## Measure Relationships

### Condition Correlations

High correlations between measures indicate comorbidity patterns:

| Pair | Correlation | Clinical Relationship |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| DIABETES ↔ OBESITY | 0.72 | Metabolic syndrome |
| DIABETES ↔ BPHIGH | 0.68 | Vascular complications |
| CHD ↔ BPHIGH | 0.74 | Cardiovascular risk |
| CHD ↔ DIABETES | 0.62 | Shared risk factors |
| COPD ↔ CSMOKING | 0.78 | Causal relationship |
| DEPRESSION ↔ OBESITY | 0.48 | Bidirectional |
| DEPRESSION ↔ CASTHMA | 0.52 | Comorbidity |
